      "description":"The developing of cloud computing, big data, open source software, and improved algorithms kicked Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the mainstream of focus in technologies nowadays. AI technologies are fundamentally changing the ways we work, live, and manage businesses. This course is designed to present to student the coherent body of ideas and methods which were contributed to the development of Artificial Intelligence discipline. Student will be acquaint with the basic programs in the field and their underlying theory and will explore this through problem-solving paradigms, logic and theorem proving, language and image understanding, search and control methods and learning. This course aims to create following results on students:\n1. Graduates will have ability to work with Tensor Flow machine learning library as a framework in developing AI their applications\nMO-1a: An ability to build models by plugging together building blocks with the user-friendly Keras sequential API.\nMO-1b: An ability to build models then write the forward and backward pass, create custom layers, activations, and training loops by using a define-by-run interface for customization and advanced research from Keras functional and subclassing APIs.\n2. Graduates will have a broad understanding of the fundamental theories, concepts, and applications of Artificial Intelligence.\nMO-2a: An ability to apply knowledge of Artificial Intelligence appropriate to the discipline.\nMO-2b: An ability to analyze a problem and identify and define the AI requirements appropriate to its solution.\nMO-2c: An ability to design, implement, and evaluate an AI system to meet desired needs.\n3. Graduates will be prepared for careers in Artificial Intelligence field.\nMO-3a: An ability to use current methodologies, techniques, skills, and tools necessary for AI practice.\n4. Graduates will communicate effectively, both orally and in writing of Artificial Intelligence-related works.\nMO-4a: An ability to communicate effectively in AI-related works.\nMO-4b: An ability to discuss about how to control and to manage APIs of Tensor Flow library effectively.",
